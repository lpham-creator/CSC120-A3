Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
+ I did not consult any classmate but I asked my brother who's proficient at Java.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
+ I attended 2/14 Tuesday TA hours 7-9, 2/15 Wednesday TA hours 7-9.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
+ Its syntax is more complicated than Python's, especially when you have to think in an object-oriented way.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
+ I think that programming is like trying to make a machine run. No matter the route (procedural or OOP), the end goal is that the program executes seamlessly.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
+ My bot could carry out conversation in a determined number of round, but it freezes for 3 initial responses from the user before it actually responds. Maybe I would advise them to learn something about Java's syntax first before taking this class!
